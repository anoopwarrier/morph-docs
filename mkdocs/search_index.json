This User Guide is maintained in its own \ngithub repository\n. If you have suggestions, corrections, or improvements, you can \nlog an issue\n or even fix it yourself and \nmake a pull request\n.\n\n\nOverview - What is Morph?\n\n\nThe Sensel Morph is a multi-touch, pressure sensitive, and reconfigurable control surface for artists, musicians, coders, and other creative types. It changes function depending on which Overlay you place on top, but you can also use it without Overlays, and even create your own Overlay designs. It works using Bluetooth 4.0LE or USB connections.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\nHighly Sensitive\n:\n\n\n\n\nApprox. 20,000 pressure sensors 5g - 5kg sensing range per touch (32,000 levels)\n\n\n\n\nExtremely Fast\n:\n\n\n\n\nFull Resolution Mode: 125 Hz (8 ms latency)\n\n\nHigh Speed Mode: 500 Hz (2 ms latency)\n\n\n\n\nPrecise Tracking\n:\n\n\n\n\n6502 dpi\n\n\n\n\nVersatile Connectivity\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth LE, USB, Serial (enabled with Innovator's Kit)\n\n\n\n\nOn-the-Go Power\n\n\n\n\nUSB, Rechargeable Lithium Ion Polymer Battery\n\n\n\n\nWhat's in the box\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorph\n\n\n3ft.

Only distributions that use the \nbluez\n stack will support BLE MIDI.\n\n\n2\n - Supported in Android Marshmallow and up\n\n\nQuick Start\n\n\nThis guide will help you get your Morph out of the box and working with your computer or mobile device.\n\n\n1 Download Software\n\n\nDownload the SenselApp mapping and configuration application from \nthe Sensel website.\n This is a great tool for getting the most out of your Morph, and essential for updating its firmware.\n\n\n2 USB connection\n\n\n\n\nRemove the Morph and the supplied USB Micro cable from the box.\n\n\nConnect the Morph to your Windows or MacOS computer with the USB cable.\n\n\nThe Morph will power up and automatically connect to your operating system.\n\n\n\n\n3 Update Firmware\n\n\nMake sure you have a reliable internet connection and launch the Sensel App on your computer with the Morph connected. The application will query our servers and find out if there is a firmware update available. If there is an update available, update your firmware and continue.\n\n\n4 Launch the Visualizer\n\n\nThe Visualizer is the easiest way to see activity on your Morph and confirm that the hardware is communicating with your computer.\n\n\n\n\nTurning On, Turning Off\n\n\n\n\nTurn the Morph off by holding the button down for a few seconds. When the red LED light goes off, release the button. If you release the button before the light goes off, the Morph will still be drawing power.\n\n\nThe Morph will automatically turn on when connected to a USB host.\n\n\nIf off, hold the button down for a second or so to turn on. Release when the LED light turns white (USB) or turns blue (wireless).\n\n\nIf the Morph is plugged into USB, disconnecting from USB will turn power off.\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nAt first glance, the Sensel Morph appears a fairly simple piece of hardware. It consists of a flat rectangular area of force-sensing circuitry, a slightly raised area that contains additional processing circuitry, LEDs, a button, and micro USB connector. This sleek hardware is actually quite powerful, as you\u2019ll find out. \n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\nLEDS\n\n\nThere are two locations for LEDs on the Morph. The single LED on the top right corner of the device can show a variety of colors, and the LED strip which will always be white. \n\n\nStatus RGB\n\n\nThis LED changes colors to indicate different statuses. The different color and blink patterns are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nWhite\n: Communication is happening to the device over USB\n\n\nBlue stable\n: The device is in bluetooth mode\n\n\nBlue pulsing\n: The device is in bluetooth pairing mode\n\n\nYellow\n: The device is in update mode (this means you should open the Sensel App and update the firmware on your device)\n\n\nPurple\n: The device is communicating through the Developer's Cable (you won't see this unless you're using the Developer's Cable from the Innovator\u2019s Kit)\n\n\nRed\n: Indicates a low battery or powering off device. To turn off the Morph, press and hold the power button for 5 seconds. After 2 seconds the red LED will turn on. Wait until the LED turns off before releasing the power button.\n\n\n\n\nStrip\n\n\nThere is a strip of 24 white LEDs. These light up when areas are pressed on the Overlays and can be controlled with the API.\n\n\nButton\n\n\nUse to power the device on/off and put in Bluetooth pairing mode.\n\n\n\n\nPress to turn on\n\n\nHold for a few seconds to put in pairing mode (blue pulsing LED)\n\n\nHold for a few seconds to turn off (wait for red LED to go off)\n\n\nDouble click to disconnect from current device and put Morph in pairing mode\n\n\n\n\nUSB Connector\n\n\nThe Morph has a single USB micro connector for charging the battery and providing a serial connection.\n\n\nBluetooth Transmitter\n\n\nThe Morph can seamlessly switch between Bluetooth and wired operation. \nRead on\n for details on connecting to your device with Bluetooth.\n\n\nForce Sensor Surface\n\n\n\nWithout an Overlay, the force sensing surface can be used with the \nVisualizer\n in the Sensel App to view pressure levels and contact regions. It is no more or less durable than the rest of the case.\n\n\nBattery Life\n\n\nThe Morph has a built-in rechargeable 3.7 volt Lithium Ion Polymer battery rated at 420 mAh. Under normal usage, you can expect six to eight hours of use from a fully charged battery. On standby, the battery can last up to a week. \n\n\nCare and Feeding\n\n\nThe Overlays are made of silicone rubber with a silicone top-coating for a smooth feel. You can clean them with warm water and soap. While we have tested a variety of substances to ensure quality, it is known that some sunscreens and lotions can be contaminants to plastics. So, to ensure longest life for your Overlays, try not to use Overlays when your hands have excess lotion or sunscreen on them. Additionally, silicone is susceptible to tears. Once torn, it's difficult to stop. Use the handy case we provide to keep your Overlays away from loose change, hairpins, keys, or other sharp items!\n\n\nThe LiPo battery's charge is handled by the Morph's internal electronics. However, a general rule-of-thumb for LiPo batteries is that they should not be stored at full charge. If you will not be using the Morph for a while, turn it \non\n and let the battery charge down.\n\n\nThe black surface of the pressure sensor is made of durable PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) plastic.\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\n\nThickness measurements are with the rubber feet. Subtract 0.75 mm for thickness measurements without the rubber feet.\n\n\nSensel App Software\n\n\nThe Sensel App is used to flash firmware, configure, calibrate, and confirm the functions of the Morph. You can also use it to customize and re-map button functionality on your Overlays. Download the software for Windows or macOS from the \nSensel website\n.\n\n\nIn order to use any of the features in the Sensel App, you'll need to have a wired connection between your Morph and computer. A wireless connection is not sufficient for working with the Sensel App.\n\n\nHome\n\n\nThe home page of the Sensel App allows you to select a task. You can edit the output of Overlays, update firmware, and visualize the raw data from pressure input on the Morph.\n\n\n\n\nIcons\n\n\nYou'll notice 2-3 icons in the bottom right of the application window. Here's what they mean:\n\n\n\n\n - active wifi connection for updating app and firmware\n\n\n - active usb connection with Morph\n\n\n - load help for app\n\n\n\n\nIf there's a red circle and slash, it means the connection is inactive or broken.\n\n\nOverlay Mapper\n\n\nMusic Overlays\n\n\n\n\nThe Music Production, Drum, and Piano Overlays can be completely modified from their default settings to work however you\u2019d like them to.\n\n\nWhen you select a music Overlay from the Sensel App, you'll open a screen where you can click on the different buttons or regions to modify the MIDI notes sent from the pads. \n\n\nUse the inspector's menu to select a different note value for each pad you want to change. You can save the settings to a map preset. \n\n\nWhen finished editing, be sure to click \"Send Map to Morph\" to modify the settings.\n\n\nQWERTY (+ AZERTY and DVORAK) Overlay\n\n\n\n\nIn a way, the mapper for the QWERTY Overlay is very similar to the music editors. However, instead of modifying MIDI notes, you are modifying the key event codes from each stroke. A list of keyboard codes can be found at \nthis link.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizer\n\n\n\nUse the Visualizer to view the raw pressure information coming from the Morph's sensor. The visualizer is more than entertaining, it's a look behind the scenes of what happens when you are using the Morph. \n\n\nYou can see the effects of using different materials between a stylus (or some other actuator, like a finger) and pressure surface. You can even see that very sharp styli won't generate much of a pressure reading, and benefit greatly from a material or overlay. \n\n\nThe curious and creative user will find great satisfaction in the Visualizer!\n\n\nOverlays\n\n\nQWERTY\n\n\n\n\nThe QWERTY Overlay works like a regular QWERTY keyboard. It's great for using the Morph as a keyboard for iPads and other tablets. You will need to configure it for your Operating System using the Sensel App.\n\n\nThe \nAZERTY\n and \nDVORAK\n Overlays provide access to more internationally-used keyboard layouts.\n\n\nPiano\n\n\n\n\nThe Piano Overlay sends MIDI data on Channel 1 from the Morph to your device so you can play software synths and samplers. By default, the Piano Overlay sends notes on MIDI channel 1 and the default octave starts at note 60 (C3\n1\n). You can transpose up and down two octaves with the arrow keys. Additionally, you can create vibrato by moving your fingers side-to-side, bending the note.\n\n\nThe play, stop, and record buttons send MIDI Machine Control (MMC) commands to enable those features. Some software products, such as Ableton Live, do not recognize MMC, so they will seem to not work in those cases.\n\n\nSince there is no standard MMC message for \"loop,\" the loop button sends a MIDI note, allowing you to use software MIDI latch (or learn) to use it to control the Loop function in your software.\n\n\n1\n - MIDI notes conventionally start at note number 0, named C-2. This is not a standard, as it has been broken many times, but most music software today tends to call MIDI note 60 C3. \n\n\nDrums\n\n\n\n\nThe Drum Overlay sends notes on MIDI Channel 10. The Default notes start at 36 (C3). The arrow keys transpose all notes up or down 16 semitones to better work with many software drum machines, which work in banks of 16 notes.\n\n\nThe play, stop, and record buttons send MIDI Machine Control (MMC) commands to enable those features. Some software products, such as Ableton Live, do not recognize MMC, so they will seem to not work in those cases.\n\n\nMusic Production\n\n\n\n\nThe 16 Pad grid sends on MIDI Channel 2, the controls send on MIDI Channel 2, the \"piano keys\" send on MIDI Channel 3.\n\n\nThe play, stop, and record buttons send MIDI Machine Control (MMC) commands to enable those features. Some software products, such as Ableton Live, do not recognize MMC, so they will seem to not work in those cases.\n\n\nGaming\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaming Overlay converts the Morph into a game controller. Based on popular controllers, the Gaming Overlay has everything you need to play games.\n\n\nMedia Editing\n\n\nThe Media Editing Overlay is used for editing video and sound.\n\n\nArt\n\n\n\n\nUse the Art Overlay as a high-resolution drawing interface to capture the finest strokes with a variety of brushes and styli. You can use it to create digital art with your fingers, pen and pencil over paper, paint brushes, and any other tools you\u2019d like.\n\n\nInnovator\n\n\n\n\nYour turn to make an Overlay! The Innovator's Kit works with the API. Included in the Kit is a simple UART cable which turns the microUSB port on the Morph into a UART connection for microcontrollers.\n\n\nBluetooth connection\n\n\nThe Sensel Morph is a Bluetooth 4.0 LE wireless device. This means it can function as a wireless controller for your music, drawing, or writing.\nThis section describes how to pair and un-pair your Morph to a bluetooth connection on a number of operating systems. Once the Morph is paired to your device, it will automatically connect when in range.\n\n\nPairing\n\n\nIn general, the process is as follows. Screen images for different operating systems are below.\n\n\n\n\nUnplug the Morph from any USB computer connection.\n\n\nOpen the bluetooth control panel for your computer.\n\n\nHold the button down for about one second. The Morph LEDs will flash and a blue LED will turn on after three seconds.\n\n\nClick the \"pair\" button in your computer's control panel.\n\n\nThe Morph will be paired to your device.\n\n\n\n\nUnpairing\n\n\nCurrently, the Morph can be paired with only one device. If you want to pair the Morph to a different device, you'll need to unpair the connected device and the Morph.\n\n\n\n\nTurn off the Morph\n\n\nUnpair or forget the Morph from the previously connected device.\n\n\nUnplug the Morph from any USB computer connection.\n\n\nOpen the bluetooth control panel for the new computer.\n\n\nHold the button down for about one second. The Morph LEDs will flash and a blue LED will turn on after three seconds.\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Pairing\n\n\nOnce you have un-paired the Morph, you don\u2019t need to power down and up again to pair to a different device.\n\n\n\n\nDouble click the power button. The Morph lights should flash again and the blue LED will turn on after three seconds.\n\n\nClick the \"pair\" button in your new computer's control panel.\n\n\nThe Morph will be paired to your new device.\n\n\n\n\nOS Specific Pairing Guides\n\n\nConnection guides for macOS, Windows, and Linux follow.\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\nOpen System Preferences and click the Bluetooth icon.\nPut the Morph into pairing mode. The control panel will look like:\n\n\n\n\nClick the \"pair\" button on screen. Your Morph is now paired:\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nOpen the Settings panel for Bluetooth. The easy to get there is to use the Windows search bar:\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\nOpen Settings and select Bluetooth. Put the Morph into pairing mode. Select Morph in the available devices and pair.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have paired with the Morph, you will be able to use it with the different Overlays. Here are some sample screen captures of how it shows up  in different apps:\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nPut the Morph into pairing mode. In Android's Settings app, select Bluetooth, select \"Morph\" from the available devices and pair:\n\n\n\n\nOnce paired, you can use the Morph. If you are using the QWERTY Overlay, you'll probably want to setup your keyboard so you can easily switch between on-screen and Morph. Use the keyboard icon on the bottom of your screen:\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nThere are many flavors of Linux. We are documenting one of the most common, Ubuntu 16.04. Open the Settings panel and select the Bluetooth panel\n\n\n\n\nIn the lower left of the \"Devices\" panel, click the \"\n+\n\" button to search and add the Morph.\n\n\n\n\nMost Linux relies on the bluez bluetooth stack. You can also use the command line tools to pair. Once you run the \nbluetoothctl devices\n command, you'll be in the bluetoothctl interactive shell:\n\n\n bluetoothctl devices\n[NEW] Controller 00:15:83:3D:0A:57 sensoruser [default]\n[NEW] Device 71:11:32:B0:12:A0 Morph-0194\n[bluetooth]# pair 71:11:32:B0:12:A0\n[bluetooth]# pair 71:11:32:B0:12:A0\n[bluetooth]# connect 71:11:32:B0:12:A0\n[bluetooth]# trust 71:11:32:B0:12:A0\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to disconnect, you can\n\n\nbluetoothctl remove 71:11:32:B0:12:A0\n\n\n\n\nUpdate bluez\n\n\nIf you want to update to the latest bluez software, you can get the link from the \nbluez site\n. At the time of writing, the current version is 5.44. This has some support for Bluetooth MIDI:\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev libudev-dev libical-dev\ncd ~/Downloads\nwget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/bluetooth/bluez-5.44.tar.xz\ntar xvf bluez-5.44.tar.xz\ncd bluez-5.44\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can't explicitly support all Linux, this should at least get you started.\n\n\nBluetooth MIDI configuration\n\n\nIf your operating system supports MIDI over Bluetooth, you can have a wireless MIDI controller.\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\n\n\nOpen the AudioMIDI application in macOS. Open the MIDI Studio window (cmd-2) and double-click the Bluetooth logo. If you have successfully \npaired the Morph with Bluetooth\n, you'll see your device listed here. Press \"connect\" and the Morph will be available to any MIDI applications as an input device.\n\n\nWindows\n\n\nWindows 10 Anniversary Edition and after support Bluetooth MIDI, so make sure you have the latest update. This support, however, is limited to applications that use the native windows API for MIDI (read more details \nhere\n). As a result, for common use, you'll need a couple additional pieces of software:\n\n\n\n\nMIDIberry\n\n\nloopMIDI\n\n\n\n\nThe loopMIDI application creates virtual (or \nloopback\n) MIDI ports. MIDI berry provides a connection between the Morph's Bluetooth MIDI ports and the virtual MIDI ports. In your music application, you connect to the virtual port created in loopMIDI. Screenshot examples below show loopMIDI with the virtual port, MIDIberry with the connection made, and a couple of applications using the vitrual port to get MIDI input from the Morph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtual port \"MorphMIDI Port\" created in loopMIDI (type in the field, then click \"+\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconnection between Morph bluetooth and \"MorphMIDI Port\" made in MIDIberry (just tap on an input port and an output port to connect them)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtual port \"MorphMIDI Port\" selected in the MIDI setup prefs of Bitwig Studio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvirtual port \"MorphMIDI Port\" selected in the MIDI setup prefs of FL Studio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\niOS version 8 and above support Bluetooth MIDI. These devices have Bluetooth LE support:\n\n\n\n\niPhone 4s +\n\n\niPad3 +\n\n\niPad Mini +\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Morph is paired with the iOS device, it's available as a MIDI device to most iOS MIDI-capable apps. You'll need to go into an app's preferences or setup panel to enable and configure MIDI control.\n\n\nIn some cases, you may need the \nmidimittr app\n to create a connection with the Morph which will expose the Morph's MIDI input to other apps.\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nAndroid version \nMarshmallow (6) and above\n support BLE MIDI. However, some devices support this connection type, and some don't. The best way to find out is to pair your device with the Morph via Bluetooth, then use the free \nMIDI BLE Connect\n app from the Google Play store. Open it after paring the Morph to your Android device. If there is a connection to be found, MIDI BLE Connect will scan and find it.\n\n\nLinux\n\n\nBLE MIDI has some support in the latest \nbluez\n stack, and should have more complete support in future updates according to \nthis blog\n. You are welcome to experiment! Instructions for updating to the most recently release of bluez are \nabove\n.\n\n\nUse it!\n\n\nAs the name implies, there are a lot of different ways to use the high-resolution sensor that is the Morph. What follows in this section are the nuts and bolts on getting your morph working with your device and making use of the different Overlays in different softwares.\n\n\nTest it!\n\n\nBecause the Morph is capable of so many different modes and protocols, you may need some reassurance and ways of testing. Here's some tools and suggestions for some of the different modes.\n\n\nMIDI\n\n\nIf you are unsure that your Morph is properly connected and providing MIDI input to your computer, you can test with some simple programs. If you don't know what MIDI is, it's a simple serial protocol that electronic music hardware and software uses to interoperate. Learn more \nat wikipedia\n.\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\n\n\nMIDI Monitor\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nMIDIberry\n\n\n\n\nBluetooth MIDI is available on Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, so make sure your version of Windows 10 is recently updated. It is limited to apps that use the native Windows MIDI implementation, so it probably won't show up as a MIDI input in most software.\n\n\nMIDIberry provides native MIDI hooks to Windows 10, so it can connect to the USB MIDI and the Bluetooth MIDI ports created by the Morph. MIDIberry provides a monitor function that makes it easy to confirm MIDI data input from the Morph.\n\n\niOS\n\n\n\n\nMIDI Wrench\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\nUSB MIDI Monitor\n\n\n\n\nLinux\n\n\n\n\namidi\n\n\nothers\n\n\n\n\nIf you want a GUI monitor, you can find something in the \"others\" link above.\nThe easiest way to test on Linux is to use ALSA's \namidi\n in a terminal. Plug in the Morph to your computer's USB port, then list the MIDI devices with:\n\n\namidi -l\n\n\n\n\nYou'll get something like\n\n\nDir Device      Name\nIO  hw:1,0,0    Sensel Morph MIDI 1\n\n\n\n\nArmed with the portname, you can now start dumping MIDI input to the terminal:\n\n\namidi -d -p hw:1,0,0\n\n\n\n\nQWERTY\n\n\nOpen text editor or word processing program. Try typing. Use command and option keys. Everything work? If not, you'll need to either check your connection, or use the Sensel App to make sure your QWERTY Overlay is configured for your OS.\n\n\nMusic Software Guides\n\n\nFor the most part, when the Morph is used as a MIDI device, it shows up like any other MIDI keyboard or controller. However, there are some details worth documenting, since, with default mappings, each Overlay sends on a different channel. Before you proceed make sure you have a wired or wireless connection between your device and the Morph.\n\n\nThe below screenshots show the Morph used as a Bluetooth MIDI device, but the general instructions do not change for the wired case or for different operating systems.\n\n\nAbleton Live\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Preferences window in Ableton Live and select the MIDI tab. If you just want to play the keyboard and drums, turn \"Track\" on for the input port. If you want to use controls and buttons for parameters and switches in Live, turn \"Remote\" on for the input port. At this time, there is no MIDI control of the Morph, so there is no need to activate \"Track\" or \"Remote\" for output.\n\n\nIn Ableton Live, you can filter MIDI input on tracks according to Channel. You may want to do this to ensure different Overlays are dedicated to different tracks.\n\n\n\n\nBitwig Studio\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Preferences window in Bitwig Studio and select the Settings, then Controllers tabs. Select \"Generic\" (though the Morph is anything but generic!), then choose either \"MIDI Keyboard\" or \"Keyboard + 8 Device Knobs\".\n\n\nThe \nMIDI Keyboard\n option makes it easy to play notes in any of the instruments. If you want to map the extra CC controls of the Music Production Overlay to different parameters in Bitwig, you can use Bitwig's MIDI learn feature in the Mappings Browser Panel.\n\n\nThe \nKeyboard + 8 Device Knobs\n will make the Music Production Overlay nicer to work with. You can use the Sensel App to remap the knobs to CC values 20-27, and Bitwig will automatically map the eight knobs to the currently selected Device Macros.\n\n\nIn this setup, both options have been added as Controllers, though only one is active.\n\n\n\nNote that it is not possible to filter MIDI Channels in Bitwig tracks. If you want to do more advanced filtering and controls, you can use Bitwig's Controller Scripting API and create a control script.\n\n\nFL Studio\n\n\nFL Studio is Windows-only, with a macOS alpha in the works.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the MIDI Settings window from the Options menu.\n\n\nSelect the Morph in the input panel.\n\n\nClick \"enable\" below the Input panel. Select a controller type \"(generic controller)\" from the menu.\n\n\nThis enables basic MIDI input for the Morph. You can get more info on using MIDI in FL Studio 12 from their documentation.\n\n\nCycling 74 Max\n\n\n\n\nMax will use any active MIDI device as an input. How you program your patch will affect what happens. The above screenshot illustrates the MIDI input selection menu that appears from double clicking on the MIDI input objects (midiin, ctlin, notein, pgmin, etc.).\n\n\nApple Logic Pro X, Garage Band, and Main Stage\n\n\n\n\nWith Apple music applications, \"it just works\" is the general idea. If it shows up in AudioMIDI Setup, it will provide input to recording-armed tracks to play software synths, samplers, and drums.\n\n\nIf you want to add more controls for effects and synths, you can use Logic's \"Learn Controls\" features.\n\n\n\n\nYou may need to edit some values in the Expert View, since sometimes Logic will guess incorrectly about the format of incoming data. The procedure is similar for Main Stage.\n\n\nGarage Band offers no remote control of parameters from MIDI devices. You can only play instruments with note and pitchbend input.\n\n\nPresonus StudioOne 2\n\n\n\n\nOpen the Presonus preferences panel and select the \nExternal Devices\n tab. Press the \n\"Add...\"\n button to add a new MIDI controller.\n\n\n\n\nIn the resulting \nEdit Device\n panel, you can add \"Sensel\" to the Manufacturer field and \"Morph\" to \"Device Name\" field. Press the \nAll\n button to receive MIDI on all channels. Select the Morph in the \"Receive From\" menu (there is no need to select the Morph in the Send To menu, since there is currently no MIDI control of the Morph).\n\n\nEngage \"Split Channels\" if you would like to create a separate Instrument Track input for each MIDI channel from the Keyboard. You will probably want to enable Split Channels as pictured, since each Overlay sends on a different MIDI channel.\n\n\nYou can choose to use this Keyboard as your \"Default Instrument Input\" by checking the appropriate box. If you are using only one Keyboard with Studio One, you should check this box.\n\n\nPropellerheads Reason\n\n\nReason has several ways of using a MIDI keyboard or controller. The most basic is to just add the Morph as a keyboard.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Reason's Preferences panel, and select the \nControl Surfaces\n tab. Click the \nAdd\n button, and select the \"\n\" from the \nManufacturer\n menu and \"MIDI Control Keyboard\" from the \nModel\n menu. You can type \"Sensel Morph\" into the \nName\n field. Finally, select the Morph from the \nMIDI Input\n menu.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have set that up, you can make a more sophisticated setup to filter channels\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \"Sync\" tab and add the Sensel Morph to at least one of the External Control Buses, as pictured above.\n\n\n\n\nNow you can use the Hardware device in the Reason Rack and click the \nADVANCED MIDI\n button to expose the selectors. It is here that you can map MIDI channels (and thereby different Overlays) from the Morph to different devices in your rack.\n\n\nAPI\n\n\nThere's a software API for Python, Processing, and C/C++.
