#### Other Programs
These programs are worth investigating, since they are popular. TKTK
##### Ardour (linux)
##### Hydrogen (linux)
##### Reaper
##### ProTools
##### Kontakt
##### Massive
##### Maschine
Although Maschine comes with its own hardware for sequencing and playing drums, you may want to use the highly-sensitive and playable surface of the Morph to play the extensive soundbanks and effects in the Maschine software.
###### Standalone
###### VST

##### Traktor
You can use the reliable Morph to trigger samples and control effects in Tracktor, but you'll need to design your own Control Surface Setup to make it do what you want to do. This is not a complete tutorial on creating a setup in Traktor, but is designed to get you started with mapping the Morph to Traktor. (hint: use the Sensel Mapper software to mimic the MIDI output from another similar controller, then use that Setup.)
